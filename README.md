### Project Description
This project lets users log in, click a big animated button, and watch a global counter go up in real time.
It also includes a leaderboard to see who‚Äôs clicked the most, making an otherwise useless button oddly competitive.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People around the world suffer from a tragic lack of buttons to click endlessly without purpose.
There‚Äôs no global platform to turn mindless clicking into a competitive sport ‚Äî until now.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built The Infinity Button ‚Äî a gloriously useless web app where you log in, smash a shiny animated button, and watch your counter climb to‚Ä¶ well, infinity.
With leaderboards, click animations, and absolutely no meaningful reward, it‚Äôs the ultimate waste of time ‚Äî but make it competitive.
